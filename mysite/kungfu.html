            <br>
            The term kung fu, gung fu, or gongfu stands for the wide variety of Chinese Martial Arts. In Chinese, gōngfu (功夫) is a mix of two words, combining 功 (gōng) meaning "work", "achievement", or "merit", and 夫 (fū) which is the word man, so gō.
              
            <h2>What have I learned???</h2>

                <br>
            
            <p> I break to Sifu whereever I see him as a sign of respect.  Sifu means "master" or "teacher".  I also break at the entrance of my classroom. </p>
                
            <p> Qi is an energy flow.  It gives you the strength.  It tightens your belly muscles.  The ancient Chinese described qi as "life force". By understanding the rhythm and flow of qi, they believed they could guide exercises and treatments to provide stability and longevity.</p>
                
            <p>All stances are preformed in a 3x3 square.Low stances help keep you more strong, so even if an attacker tries to make you stumble, you will be less likely to fall.</p>

            <p>Sashes in my Kung fu school start at 10th and end at 1st(only lower levels). I have a Green Belt (7th Lower Level).</p>
