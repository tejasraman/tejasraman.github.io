                <p>I love reading fantasy fiction books like Harry Potter and Keeper of the Lost Cities!  I love math, latin, spanish and english.</p>
                
                <p>My most favorite class is design where they give us the idea on what we have to make and I get to create new and unique projects based on that idea.</p>
                
                <p>I like to challenge myself and try to do new things.  I love to learn anything new and interesting!</p>
                
                <p>My newest challenge and interest is to get into the finals of the spelling bee! I participated in the spelling bee for the first time this year and was placed the 23rd place in the Scripps Naitonal Spelling Bee! &#128029; </p>
