        <p>A Guitar is a fretted instrument with 6 strings. The guitar is classified as a chordophone, meaning the sound is produced by a vibrating string stretched between two fixed points. &#127928; </p>
       
            
        <p>I started off learning a Ukulele before starting to learn the Guitar.  A Ukulele is an instrument with 4 strings.  The word ukulele means bouncing fleas in Hawaiian. The ukulele was named  and made in Hawaii, but was inspired by Portugal's four-stringed machete. People used to bring guitars out to sea to sing on a ship. Then, people from Portugal traded ukuleles in Hawaii. That is when the ukulele got its name.<img src="https://img.icons8.com/external-xnimrodx-lineal-color-xnimrodx/24/000000/external-ukulele-music-xnimrodx-lineal-color-xnimrodx.png"/>

        <p>I enjoyed playing the ukulele, but I think I enjoy playing the guitar more. &#127928; </p>
            
        <p>I play an Acoustic guitar, where the sound is produced by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument. When a string is plucked its vibration is transmitted from the bridge, resonating throughout the top of the guitar. It is also transmitted to the side and back of the instrument, resonating through the air in the body, and producing sound from the sound hole. &#127928; </p>
