            <p>I have always loved computers! When I was two years old, I used to play games on my parent's macbook. Once day I accidentally spilled lemonade over the keyboard and fried the logic board. And Dad was so mad!!&#x1F628; Anyhow, he was able to fix it. That macbook went up in smokes in 2021 and I took over parents' old laptop which we got in 2012. </p>

            <table>
                
            <td id="box1">I got a Raspberry Pi 3B for my 7th birthday. We installed Raspbian OS and Ubuntu MATE on it. One day, i wanted to rearrange icons in the menu bar and accidentally typed something in the terminal, and wiped my whole computer's user interface and app menu! I had to get a new login! Luckily, it was fixed! &#x1F603; </td>

            <p>I hoped that I would learn from my mistakes and not to repeat such incidents but well!!!! &#129335;</p> 
            
            <p>I am now learning to code in Python and HTML. I plan to build my own computer one day.   </p>
